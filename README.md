This Rust program calculates the final score and grade for students based on their written exam and Continuous Assessment Test (CAT) scores. 
The grading criteria are different for medical and non-medical courses.
This program takes into account the final CAT score out of 30 and the final written exam score out of 70, summing them to determine the final grade.
The program validates input scores for written exams and CATs, calculates the final score by summing the written exam score and CAT score, determines the grade based on the final score and course type (medical or non-medical), ensures input scores are within valid ranges (written exam score range 0 to 70, CAT score range 0 to 30)
